                <p><b>“Slave I was Born, Slave I will Die”</b> is a powerful story that delves into the deeper meaning and complexities of life and what surrounds it. A fiction book that will assist you to improve the quality of your life and the ones around, than any other book or work of its kind, ever had.</p>
                <p>The narrative revolves around the American character who rises to become an accomplished and acclaimed entrepreneur and finds himself confined to a prison cell of Dubai.</p>
                <p>Adam’s future hangs in the balance as everything has gone tragically wrong in his life. More trouble lies ahead for the American expat living in the UAE, but his isolation and unexpected encounters with a complete stranger, Isaac, bring up many memories and moments of introspection.
                <p>The story dips back and forth in time as Adam takes stock of the drama and mayhem of his personal and professional life.</p>
                <p>Isaac’s seemingly bizarre questions both confuse and intrigue the usually self-assured and sharp Adam. He is outraged by his failures and certain guilt-ridden realizations. But will this help the once charismatic businessman bear the dreadful mess he has created for himself? Should he accept his appalling fate? Or is there a way to freedom?</p>
                <p>Set against the glitzy skyscrapers of New York and the opulent high life of the UAE, the story takes readers on an exciting journey of misguided passion; of family love and expectation; of ambition, of pride, greed, spiritual bankruptcy, and ultimately self-realization.</p>
                <p>If the trailer has caught your imagination, the picture is in the book. If you are interested, kindly check the link below. The book is available on Amazon in ebook & paperback versions both.</p>
